**Technique**

Placing orders: Requires a increasing collection of sell orders and a decreasing 
collection of buy orders, both by price and time.

Cancelling orders: Requires a hashmap between oid and the corresponding iterator 
in the orders collection. When a cancel order is received, the hash map allows
the corresponding order in the order book to be deleted, then the hash map entry
itself is removed.

Printing orders: By construction, buy and sell order collections cannot have 
overlapping prices (otherwise those entries would be executed). So, this requires
iterating through sell collection in order of decreasing prices, then buy collection 
in order of decreasing prices.

Note that the examples weren't clear how printing should work for multiple symbols.
In this solution, orders are printed in decreasing price, grouped by their symbol.

**Performance**
Let n and m be the same side and opposite side order size, respectively, for a particular symbol.

Placing orders
- Amortized O(log n + log m) performance since each order is placed once and filled
some small constant number of times before being completely filled.
- Worst case O(log n + m log m) performance (where all opposite side orders have to 
be iterated over)

Cancelling orders
- Worse case O(log n) performance. O(1) to delete from buy/sell_orders_by_oid_ and
O(log n) to delete and possibly rebalance the buy/sell_side tree maps.

Printing orders: This can be extremely expensive since every order book is being
printed. O(n log n + m log m) per symbol.


**Problem Documentation**

SimpleCross - a process that matches internal orders

Overview:
    * Accept/remove orders as they are entered and keep a book of
      resting orders
    * Determine if an accepted order would be satisfied by previously
      accepted orders (i.e. a buy would cross a resting sell)
    * Output (print) crossing events and remove completed (fully filled)
      orders from the book

Inputs:
    A string of space separated values representing an action.  The number of
    values is determined by the action to be performed and have the following
    format:

    ACTION [OID [SYMBOL SIDE QTY PX]]

    ACTION: single character value with the following definitions
    O - place order, requires OID, SYMBOL, SIDE, QTY, PX
    X - cancel order, requires OID
    P - print sorted book (see example below)

    OID: positive 32-bit integer value which must be unique for all orders

    SYMBOL: alpha-numeric string value. Maximum length of 8.

    SIDE: single character value with the following definitions
    B - buy
    S - sell

    QTY: positive 16-bit integer value

    PX: positive double precision value (7.5 format)

Outputs:
    A list of strings of space separated values that show the result of the
    action (if any).  The number of values is determined by the result type and
    have the following format:

    RESULT OID [SYMBOL [SIDE] (FILL_QTY | OPEN_QTY) (FILL_PX | ORD_PX)]

    RESULT: single character value with the following definitions
    F - fill (or partial fill), requires OID, SYMBOL, FILL_QTY, FILL_PX
    X - cancel confirmation, requires OID
    P - book entry, requires OID, SYMBOL, SIDE, OPEN_QTY, ORD_PX (see example below)
    E - error, requires OID. Remainder of line represents string value description of the error

    FILL_QTY: positive 16-bit integer value representing qty of the order filled by
              this crossing event

    OPEN_QTY: positive 16-bit integer value representing qty of the order not yet filled

    FILL_PX:  positive double precision value representing price of the fill of this
              order by this crossing event (7.5 format)

    ORD_PX:   positive double precision value representing original price of the order (7.5 format)
              (7.5 format means up to 7 digits before the decimal and exactly 5 digits after the decimal)

Conditions/Assumptions:
    * The implementation should be a standalone Linux console application (include
      source files, testing tools and Makefile in submission)
    * The use of third party libraries is not permitted. 
    * The app should respond to malformed input and other errors with a RESULT
      of type 'E' and a descriptive error message
    * Development should be production level quality. Design and
      implementation choices should be documented
	* Performance is always a concern in software, but understand that this is an unrealistic test. 
	  Only be concerned about performance where it makes sense to the important sections of this application (i.e. reading actions.txt is not important).
    * All orders are standard limit orders (a limit order means the order remains in the book until it
      is either canceled, or fully filled by order(s) for its same symbol on the opposite side with an
      equal or better price).
    * Orders should be selected for crossing using price-time (FIFO) priority
    * Orders for different symbols should not cross (i.e. the book must support multiple symbols)
